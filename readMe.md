I am creating a basic weather app that will include the following:

A landing page that welcomes you to the App. It will also include a suggestion on something random you can do today. The idea behind this is just really to encourage the user to do something different or just get up and do something. Often times the weather app is one of the first apps we open up in the day.

after a few seconds the landing page will direct you to the home page (home.html)once you are there you will be able to search the city of your choosing and you will see full weather information + the air quality status (which is the 3rd API)

Pain points:

I created a saved cities page and got saving to local storage to semi work, but right now it is only posting an empty array to localstorage. I hope to continue to work on this so that my saved cities page is fully functional.

If I could make this project perfect I would populate an image into the card that pops up when you search. I already have an API that works, but the API needed a package and trying to get the image to populate from there (because it isn't a normal API where you can fetch it) has been posing me problems. I currently have my work on that commented out, but once I get my saved cities page functional I will then work on this feature as an additional bonus.
