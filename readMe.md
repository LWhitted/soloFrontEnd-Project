I am creating a basic weather app that will include the following:

A landing page that welcomes you to the App. It will also include a suggestion on something random you can do today. The idea behind this is just really to encourage the user to do something different or just get up and do something. Often times the weather app is one of the first apps we open up in the day.

once you fully open the app you will be able to search the city of your choosing and you will see full weather information + the air quality status (which is the 3rd API)

If I have time I will try to figure out a way to provide a link to more weather information if the user is interested.

because the APIs are pretty simple, I am hoping to do a lot of cool things with bootstrap!
